    "Q1: What tradeoffs exist between good accuracy and quick\n",
    "    convergence?\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller convergence threshold (e.g., 1e-3) forces the model to train for more epochs before stopping, which results in more stable weight updates and higher accuracy. In contrast, a larger threshold (e.g., 1e-1) allows the model to stop earlier, saving computation time but often at the cost of underfitting and lower accuracy. Batch size also plays a critical role: smaller batches lead to noisier gradients and slower convergence, but they sometimes encourage better generalization. Larger batches, on the other hand, provide smoother gradient estimates and converge in fewer epochs, but they can plateau at lower accuracy. Thus, achieving higher accuracy typically requires smaller thresholds and moderate batch sizes, whereas quick convergence is achieved with larger thresholds and larger batches, though with weaker performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Why do you think the batch size led to the results you received?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the heatmap, we can see that very small batch sizes (like 1 or 8) lead to higher accuracy, but they also take more epochs because the updates are noisy and slower to settle down. As the batch size grows (64, 512), training becomes faster and smoother, but accuracy starts to drop compared to the small batches. For the very large batch size (4096), the model converges very quickly, but accuracy is the worst, since the updates are too “smooth” and the model stops learning useful patterns. "

    "When I ran the model with unnormalized data, the runtime was shorter (fewer epochs), but the accuracy was much lower compared to the normalized dataset. This happens because without normalization, features on very different scales distort gradient updates, leading the model to converge poorly. Normalization balances the feature scales, allowing gradient descent to train more effectively and achieve much higher accuracy."

    "<!-- **Solution:**  \n",
    "I found out that the runtime is small(small spochs), however the accuracy is largely low compared to the origianl dataset. In the normalized data, continuous features like \"age,\" \"hours-per-week,\" \"capital-gain\"/\"capital-loss,\"...have been scaled down. The reason is that large-valued features (like capital-gain) produce much larger gradients compared to small features (like education-num), so the optimization heavily skews towards them. This leads to poor convergence and low accuracy. By normalizing the feature, all features are scaled to a similar range, so the model can learn weights fairly across all inputs, converging more stably and accurately. -->"

    "\n",
    "When training on normalized_data_nosens.csv (with sex and race removed), the model’s accuracy was actually slightly higher than with the full dataset. This suggests that sex and race were not strong independent predictors once other features such as education, occupation, and hours worked were included. Their removal may have reduced noise or collinearity, allowing the model to generalize better. Therefore, we cannot conclude that sex and race have a strong correlation with education or other predictors just based on accuracy results. The increase in accuracy is more likely due to feature redundancy than a lack of real-world correlation."
